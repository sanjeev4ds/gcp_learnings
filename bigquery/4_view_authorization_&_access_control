What is authorized view and its use case?
- Share query results with particular users and groups without giving them access to the underlying tables.
- Use the views SQL query to restrict the columns (fields) the users are able to query
- Source tables and view should be in different dataset.
- Grant necessary IAM roles to user at project and dataset level.
- Authorize view from source dataset.

BigQuery Data Viewer-------> Dataset: shared_views -------->  view:service_requests_analyst_view ---authorized_view--->Dataset: (source_dataset)

Steps-
Create a separate dataset (new), to store max views query source dataset
e.g- Share_view
query->
Create or replace view share_view.share_view_demo
as
Select
  symbol,
  description,
  sector
from
  'project_id.dataset_id.table_name';

- Now above views have been create on view dataset, provide access to these views to required user_emails/ groups. and provide BigQuery user role.
- above will be done via Iam admin.
- On view dataset, share-> permissions-> BigQuery Data Viewer (role) {provide this}.

- Even if user have access to view dataset, he will not be able to access view table.

- Go to main tables dataset (source dataset), from original owner account-
  - share
    - Authorized view
      - give (view name)
    <> this way, view will have access to dataset
    & user access to view, can access query according to view columns.
