Section 2: Ingesting and processing the data (~25% of the exam)

2.1 Planning the data pipelines. Considerations include:
  ● Defining data sources and sinks
  ● Defining data transformation logic
  ● Networking fundamentals
  ● Data encryption

2.2 Building the pipelines. Considerations include:
  ● Data cleansing
  ● Identifying the services (e.g., Dataflow, Apache Beam, Dataproc, Cloud Data Fusion,
    BigQuery, Pub/Sub, Apache Spark, Hadoop ecosystem, and Apache Kafka)
  ● Transformations
    ○ Batch
    ○ Streaming (e.g., windowing, late arriving data)
    ○ Language
    ○ Ad hoc data ingestion (one-time or automated pipeline)
  ● Data acquisition and import
  ● Integrating with new data sources

2.3 Deploying and operationalizing the pipelines. Considerations include:
  ● Job automation and orchestration (e.g., Cloud Composer and Workflows)
  ● CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment)
