Section 1: Designing data processing systems (~22% of the exam)

1.1 Designing for security and compliance. Considerations include:
  ● Identity and Access Management (e.g., Cloud IAM and organization policies)
  ● Data security (encryption and key management)
  ● Privacy (e.g., personally identifiable information, and Cloud Data Loss Prevention API)
  ● Regional considerations (data sovereignty) for data access and storage
  ● Legal and regulatory compliance

1.2 Designing for reliability and fidelity. Considerations include:
  ● Preparing and cleaning data (e.g., Dataprep, Dataflow, and Cloud Data Fusion)
  ● Monitoring and orchestration of data pipelines
  ● Disaster recovery and fault tolerance
  ● Making decisions related to ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability)
    compliance and availability
  ● Data validation

1.3 Designing for flexibility and portability. Considerations include:
  ● Mapping current and future business requirements to the architecture
  ● Designing for data and application portability (e.g., multi-cloud and data residency
    requirements)
  ● Data staging, cataloging, and discovery (data governance)

1.4 Designing data migrations. Considerations include:
  ● Analyzing current stakeholder needs, users, processes, and technologies and creating
    a plan to get to desired state
  ● Planning migration to Google Cloud (e.g., BigQuery Data Transfer Service, Database
    Migration Service, Transfer Appliance, Google Cloud networking, Datastream)
  ● Designing the migration validation strategy
  ● Designing the project, dataset, and table architecture to ensure proper data
    governance
