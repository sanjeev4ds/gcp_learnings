Section 3: Storing the data (~20% of the exam)

3.1 Selecting storage systems. Considerations include:
  ● Analyzing data access patterns
  ● Choosing managed services (e.g., Bigtable, Spanner, Cloud SQL, Cloud Storage,
    Firestore, Memorystore)
  ● Planning for storage costs and performance
  ● Lifecycle management of data

3.2 Planning for using a data warehouse. Considerations include:
  ● Designing the data model
  ● Deciding the degree of data normalization
  ● Mapping business requirements
  ● Defining architecture to support data access patterns

3.3 Using a data lake. Considerations include:
  ● Managing the lake (configuring data discovery, access, and cost controls)
  ● Processing data
  ● Monitoring the data lake

3.4 Designing for a data mesh. Considerations include:
  ● Building a data mesh based on requirements by using Google Cloud tools (e.g.,
    Dataplex, Data Catalog, BigQuery, Cloud Storage)
  ● Segmenting data for distributed team usage
  ● Building a federated governance model for distributed data systems
