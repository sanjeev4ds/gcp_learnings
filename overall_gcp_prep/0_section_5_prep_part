Section 5: Maintaining and automating data workloads (~18% of the exam)

5.1 Optimizing resources. Considerations include:
  ● Minimizing costs per required business need for data
  ● Ensuring that enough resources are available for business-critical data processes
  ● Deciding between persistent or job-based data clusters (e.g., Dataproc)

5.2 Designing automation and repeatability. Considerations include:
  ● Creating directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) for Cloud Composer
  ● Scheduling jobs in a repeatable way

5.3 Organizing workloads based on business requirements. Considerations include:
  ● Flex, on-demand, and flat rate slot pricing (index on flexibility or fixed capacity)
  ● Interactive or batch query jobs

5.4 Monitoring and troubleshooting processes. Considerations include:
  ● Observability of data processes (e.g., Cloud Monitoring, Cloud Logging, BigQuery
    admin panel)
  ● Monitoring planned usage
  ● Troubleshooting error messages, billing issues, and quotas
  ● Manage workloads, such as jobs, queries, and compute capacity (reservations)

5.5 Maintaining awareness of failures and mitigating impact. Considerations include:
  ● Designing system for fault tolerance and managing restarts
  ● Running jobs in multiple regions or zones
  ● Preparing for data corruption and missing data
  ● Data replication and failover (e.g., Cloud SQL, Redis clusters)
